### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist currently working in behavioral healthcare.  Most of my work tied to my current and last few $JOB roles isn't public, but I developed some open source R and python packages during my time as a PhD student at Stanford in the Greenleaf Lab and have contributed to a few projects on the side since.

My graduate school projects are the ones in the pinned repositories that are part of the GreenleafLab organization. During graduate school I also developed as part of an internship with Genentech the [iheatmapr](https://github.com/ropensci/iheatmapr) package for interactive heatmaps in R.  

Most of my side projects are around data visualization -- I've contributed to the `vegawidget` ecoysystem of R packages, and created the [vlbuildr](https://github.com/vegawidget/vlbuildr) package, which is a (still-experimental) port of vega-lite to R via an auto-generated api.
